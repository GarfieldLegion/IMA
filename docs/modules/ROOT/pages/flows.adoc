# IMA Bridge Example Flow Diagrams

The IMA bridge is a very modular and expandable system. To illustrate some different ways the bridge can be setup by a SKALE Chain owner, please reference the below diagrams. Besides supporting ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 natively, the IMA bridge can be expanded to any other token type or arbitrary message (See xref:message-proxy.adoc["Managing other contracts using Message Proxy]). 

Also, a SKALE Chain owner can setup the bridge in different ways, for example:

* **manual (permission-by-owner)**: allows the Owner to permit only certain token types to transfer through the bridge, or
* **automatic (permissionless)**: allows any token deposits to automatically map and transfer through the bridge.

Please see manual or automatic flows below for more information, and check out xref:access-control.adoc[IMA Access Control] for additional information.
